## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# PYSCH-251 

## Week2

Here are `r 2^10` apples my dog needs tonight! 

### Code is cool

```{r}

x <- have("ldt-design-item-difficulties.csv")

```

```{r example figure, fig.height = 4}
x = 2
x + 2
plot(force)
```

```{}
```

# 
summary(cars)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

x <- round(t.test(mtcars$mp)$p.value,4)
print(x)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
